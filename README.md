Challenges Faced
Unit Measurement Validation: Ensuring correct unit measurement usage for input parameters.
Favicon Path: Struggled to correctly specify the path to the favicon.
Improvements
Added input parameter validation to calcNewVelocity function.
Checked unit measurement for all input parameters to ensure consistency and accuracy in calculations.
What I Learned
Importance of unit measurement validation in calculations.
Refactoring for readability and maintainability of code.
Ways to Improve
Implement unit tests for functions to ensure accuracy and robustness.
Use constants for unit conversion factors to improve code readability and maintenance.
Conclusion
Through this debugging process, I've learned the importance of validating input parameters and unit measurements in calculations. By ensuring that the code is robust and error-free, I've improved its reliability and accuracy. Moving forward, I will continue to apply these principles to write cleaner and more maintainable code.
